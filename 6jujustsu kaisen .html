Synopsis
Setting
In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called 
Cursed Energy (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative
emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary 
people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result,
they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth
 of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose
primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses 
are shown as gruesome monsters: onryō (vengeful spirit), yūrei
(ghosts), and yōkai.

Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. "Cursed 
Technique Masters" or "Shamans") are people who have the ability to
control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, 
allowing them to use it as they please and reduce its release.
High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this 
energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, Jujutsushiki),
which tend to be unique to the user or their family.
 An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開,
Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket dimension 
of variable size. Inside the Domain, all of their attacks are
guaranteed to hit and will grow in strength.
