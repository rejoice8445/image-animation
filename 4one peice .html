<i>One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a fantasy adventure television series developed by Matt Owens and Steven Maeda for
    Netflix. The series is a live-action adaptation of the manga series of the same name by Eiichiro Oda, who serves as
    creative consultant for the show. It is produced by Kaji Productions and Shueisha, who also publishes the manga. The
    series stars an ensemble cast including Iñaki Godoy, Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Jacob Romero Gibson, and Taz Skylar as the
    members of the Straw Hat Pirates, centered around (Godoy's) Captain Monkey D. Luffy.
    The first season was released on Netflix on August 31, 2023,[1] receiving positive reviews from critics and fans alike,
    praising the performances, writing, visual effects, and general fidelity to the source material.[2][3] Several outlets
    have characterized the production as one of the best live-action adaptations of a manga or anime series.[4][5] One Piece
    was the most-watched Netflix show (among individual series seasons) during the second half of 2023.[6] Two weeks after
    its release, Netflix renewed the series for a second season, which began filming in June 2024.[7][8]</i>
