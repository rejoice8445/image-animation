Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. 
It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers
and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts:
the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). 
The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable
mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014, with
its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North American production and serialized
Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television series by
Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo. A second series, which
adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from
February 2007 to March 2017. Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations (OVAs). The
franchise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies. The story of Naruto
continues in Boruto, where Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki creates his own ninja way instead of following his father's.
